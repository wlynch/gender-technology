						<h2>The Effect of Gender on Computer Science Enrollment<br/><small>Billy Lynch</small></h2>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>
						In science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduate programs, many universities struggle with low women enrollment rates. In particular, computer science programs generally illustrate this trend. While computer science is a large and growing field, there is a considerable difference in the number of men and women enrolled in computer science classes at many universities. This difference appears to be caused by two main factors: the ability to attract women to the introductory classes of the major and the ability to retain these women within the major as they progress through classes. These two factors are heavily influenced by social dynamics that occur both at childhood and at college.
						</p>
						<p>
						While the Rutgers computer science department tries its best to accommodate women in the major, many social dynamics are outside the realm of its control. For example, student controlled enviroments such as the CAVE can create an overwhelming culture that is very intimitating for those that are new to to the major. This combined with the relative social isolation women experience within the major can cause many women to avoid or leave the major.
						</p>
						<p>
						The ability to attract women to the major lies predominantly in the educational experiences a woman has prior to college, and many social interactions between students outside the classroom cannot be controlled by the university. Student organizations create supportive communities and help remove some of the social stereotypes related to computer science majors. However, there are still problems for women that stem from a lack of early involvement in STEM fields. An analysis of how STEM fields are introduced and taught at a high school, middle school, and even elementary school level should lead to better understanding of the social influence STEM has at younger ages and will potentially lead to a greater interest in computer science and other STEM fields in a collegiate environment.

							"Further, men’s traditional monopoly of technology has been identified as key to maintaining the definition of skilled work as men’s work.  Machine-related skills and physical strength are basic measures of masculine status and self-esteem, and by implication, the least technical jobs are suitable for women."

						<blockquote>
							"Both the men and women in my study inhabit a male-dominated, high-tech, corporate world.  Managers of both sexes must present themselves so as to project an image of the authoritative manager, adopting or adapting the hegemonic masculine mode.  But while they have the heart for it, women do not have the body for it."

						<h2>Girls have stepped up their Game, but the Industry hasn’t<br/><small>Diana Ibrahim</small></h2>

						The gap between male and female gamers is coming to a close, as 47% of gamers are women.  However, the industry that produces these games is overwhelmingly male dominated, as nearly 10% of women are a part of the industry.
						</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Video Games are widely considered a “boy’s club”. The way the actual industry is, is no different. “If you are a woman in the industry, there are all these little signals that you are not part of the club, that this is not your tribe...After time, it wears you down.”</li>
							<li>The industry produces games that pander to male interests. The industry markets to women as an afterthought. “We [women] have been diverse...I’ve been alive for 25 years, and I am not a new demographic. We are not a new demographic to be served. We have been here this entire time." – Mattie Brice</li>
							<li>The lack of positive female protagonists in video games, results in a lack of girls willing to play video games at a young age.  This is more prevalent in older video games, when the gender gap in games was much larger.  However, presently video games with solely female protagonists are given a shorter end of the stick, as they do not have nearly as much backing financially.</li>
							<li>Correlation to the same reason women do not pursue careers in STEM fields, they just do not feel comfortable or confident in their abilities to get into the industry.</li>
							<li>There have been little or few efforts to make the industry more appealing to girls.</li>

						<h2>Why Women Are Not Majoring in Computer Science at Rutgers University<br/><small>Steve Kane</small></h2>

						<p>
						For the past 4 semesters, women account for only 14% of the Computer Science graduates.
						</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>The faculty in the computer science department are mostly men. A rough count of full time professors found 39 men and 4 women. Studies show that a role model of the same gender is especially important when attempting to overcome gender gaps.</li>
							<li>The high volume of men in the computer science academic spaces contribute to a low sense of belonging among women computer scientists. Computer science is not an easy major; without support from fellow computer scientists, students who avoid the academic spaces may not do as well as their classmates. For this reason, it is more likely that women will lose confidence in themselves and switch out of the major.</li>
							<li>Women are often disinterested in Computer Science due to the stereotypes that are commonly associated with computer scientists. From a very young age, computer science and other STEM fields are often associated with men.</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Connections to Readings</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>The following quote from Flitter’s article, “Female Brain Drain in Science” shows that the trends found in college extend into the business environment.</li>
							<li style="margin-left:20px; list-style:none;">“The isolation comes from always being made to feel you don’t belong,” she said. “Like when a man swears and then apologizes to you for it...” It was hard, she added, to categorize the feeling of loneliness.</li>
